    "## Implement the statistical testing approach for fault detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we interpret the statistical testing approach for fault detection. The basic idea of statistical testing approach is that we fit a multi-dimensitional distribution to the observation data under normal working condition. Then, when a new data point arrives, we design a hypothesis test to see whether the new data point is consistent with the distribution. If the new data point is consistent with the distribution, we can conclude that the fault is not due to the faulty component.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of this approach is that, to design the detection algrothim, we do not need failed data. Also, the computational time is short as all we need is just to compute the pdf and compare it to a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you need to:\n",
    "- Fit a multi-dimensitional distribution to the training dataset (all normal samples).\n",
    "- Design a fault detection algorithm based on the fitted distribution to detect faulty components.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizing the data:**  \n",
    "    The features (position, temperature, voltage) have very different scales. Normalizing or standardizing the data could potentially help the Gaussian model fit better and improve detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smoothing the data:**  \n",
    "    Applying smoothing  can reduce noise and could make the distribution estimation more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reducing feature number:**  \n",
    "    Some features may not contribute to fault detection or may introduce noise. Thus feature selection (e.g., using only temperature and voltage or position and voltage etc) can sometimes improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuning log_epsilon:**  \n",
    "    The `log_epsilon` parameter is the threshold for classifying a sample as faulty. Lowering it makes the model less sensitive (fewer faults detected, more false negatives), while increasing it makes the model more sensitive (more faults detected, more false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How to get the best value for log_epsilon:**  \n",
    "    Use a validation set or cross-validation to try different values of `log_epsilon` and select the one that gives the best F1 score or desired trade-off between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, data normalization, smoothing, feature selection, and careful threshold tuning can all help improve the performance of this approach."

    "The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) method outperforms the multivariate normal model due to its local, non-parametric nature, which allows it to effectively capture the underlying structure and density variations of the data. In contrast, the multivariate normal model relies on global, parametric assumptions, specifically that the data follow a Gaussian distribution — an assumption that is often violated in practical applications. Consequently, LOF provides a more flexible and accurate approach for identifying anomalies."

    "# Task 2 Develop a cross validation pipeline to evaluate the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of cross validation is to split the data into k subsets and use one of them as the test set and the rest as the training set. The performance of the model is evaluated only on the test dataset, while the model is trained on the training dataset. By doing this, we ensure that the evaluation of the model is independent from the training of the model. Therefore, we can detect if the model is overfitted.\n",

    "## k-fold cross validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use motor 1 as an example to develop a pipeline for cross validation. Below, you have a script that read the data, extract features and get the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use sk-learn to split the data into training and testing sets, using a k-fold cross validation with k=5. (Hint: This is a routine task which can be answered easily by language models like chatgpt. You can try prompt like this: `Generate a code in python to split the data X and y into training and testing sets, using a k-fold cross validation with k=5.`)\n",
    "2. Then, train a basic logistic regression model, without hyper-parameter tuning on the training set, and use the testing set to evaluate the performance of the model (calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score). \n",
    "3. Finally, train a logistic regression model, but use the entire dataset X and y as training data. Then, use the trained model to predict the labels of the same dataset (X). Compare the results with the previous step, and discuss why we should use cross validation to evaluate the performance of the model."

    "**Discussion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-validated results reveal a high overall accuracy of approximately 96.5%, yet the model exhibits zero precision, recall, and F1 score. This outcome indicates that the model consistently classifies all instances as belonging to the majority class (normal, label 0), thereby failing to identify any fault instances (label 1). This behavior is indicative of a severe class imbalance, where the model becomes biased toward the dominant class and is unable to generalize to minority class examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, when the model is trained and evaluated on the same dataset, the performance metrics remain virtually unchanged. This further suggests that the model is not genuinely learning to detect faults, but rather is memorizing the characteristics of the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Considerations:\n",
    "- High accuracy can be misleading in the presence of class imbalance; in such cases, precision, recall, and F1 score provide a more accurate assessment of model performance, particularly for fault detection tasks.\n",
    "- Cross-validation offers a more robust and realistic evaluation of model generalization and is essential for identifying issues such as overfitting.\n"
